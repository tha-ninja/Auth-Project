Session variables are used to store individual client’s information on the web server for later use,  as a web server does not know which client’s request to be respond because HTTP address does not maintain state.

This tutorial enables you to create sessions in PHP via Login form and web server respond according to his/her request.

In our example, we have a login form when user fills up required fields and press login button, a session will be created on server which assigns him a unique ID and stores user information for later use.
